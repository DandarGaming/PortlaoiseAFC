    <p>In 1966, Portlaoise AFC was formed. In 1991, Portlaoise AFC were against Home Farm home in Rossleighan Park in their first FAI Cup match. 
    It was a massive occassion at the time and temporary scaffolding and haybales were brought in to accomodate the vast amount of spectators.
    At the time, Portlaoise AFC did not have a changing room and the local squash courts on Ballyfin Road then the players would be brought down by bus to Rossleighan Park
    They won 3-1 against Home Farm.But ended up losing against Kilkenny City in a last minute frenzy 3-2.</p>
